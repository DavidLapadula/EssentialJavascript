# Essential JavaScript

A collection of classes, tests, and micro-projects used for practicing the essential features of JavaScript. Each section represents one Udemy course, with more detail in the [Acknowledgements](#acknowledgments) section. 

## Description/Concepts

* Arrays
    * Collections
    * Iteration
    * Mutation
    * Searching
    * Sets/Maps
* Asynchronous programming
    * Async await
    * Callbacks
    * Generators
    * Promises
* Functional programming
    * Declarative programming
    * Composition
    * Object oriented design
    * Recursion
    * Shared state
    * Side effects
    * Pure functions
* Weird Parts of JavaScript
  * Building a library
  * Lexical environment
  * Prototypes

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* These classes can be run in any JavaScript environment, however Node.js is a convenient tool for executing them.
* Node.js can be downloaded [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/current).

### Executing a class

* Clone the repository.
* Download Node.js from the link above; this should make the 'node' command available in a terminal on your machine. 
* Open a terminal in the directory of the file you would like to execute and run the following: 
```
node <filename>
```
